        <h1>Product Recommendation System using Sentiment Analysis on E-Commerce Application</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The main aim of this paper is to provide a recommender system for customers, by using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine based on accuracy, comparing performance metrics.</p>
        
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Methodology involves several steps like gathering a valid data set, pre-processing steps to remove unnecessary data, collaborative filtering of text, applying machine learning algorithms.</p>
        
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Experimenting happens in two stages. Experiment 1 outcome is compared with the second one based on the performance metrics. Two machine learning algorithms are used in this technique like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine.</p>
        
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>From the results obtained, Naive Bayes machine has the most precise conclusion. So, using sentiment analysis for recommender system, Naive Bayes has the highest preference over support vector machine.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The thesis recognizes the importance of users having a clear understanding of how recommendations are generated, contributing to a more ethical and user-friendly recommendation system. According to the experimental outcomes, the Support Vector Machine algorithm performs the best, with an accuracy rate of 95.03%.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This document is styled to enhance readability and visual appeal. I chose <strong>Arial</strong> as the primary font for its clean and modern look, which is widely used and accessible.</p>
        <p>The heading sizes are designed to create a clear hierarchy: <strong>h1</strong> is set to 2.5em for the main title, providing strong emphasis, while <strong>h2</strong> is 2em, making it distinct yet secondary. The main text size is set to 1em for comfortable reading.</p>
        <p>Color choices are made with readability in mind. The headings are a darker shade of gray (#2c3e50 for <strong>h1</strong> and #34495e for <strong>h2</strong>), which contrasts well against the light background, enhancing legibility.</p>
        <p>I implemented a margin of 20px for the body to prevent text from touching the edges of the viewport, creating a clean and organized appearance. Each heading has additional margins (30px top and 15px bottom) to clearly separate sections and enhance flow.</p>
